A way to quick develop PHP ... using Eloquent, Blade, and other things.

A PHP/JS framework for quick building up aplications - from rest services and angular.js to auto crud features. This is the first version and we must evolve it a lot. 

Run composer install first.

Them, configure your stuff at App/Config/AppConf.php.
